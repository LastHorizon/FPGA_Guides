About the Author 

Dr Alexander E. Beasley

In 2018 I was awarded a Ph.D. at the University of Bath for my work exploring the benefits and implications of dynamic partial reconfiguration on FPGA-SoC architectures. Prior to this I studied for my masters degree where I specialised in microelectronic and RF modules. I am currently employed as an FPGA design engineer for Pico Technology in the UK, focusing on the development of future generation technologies. 
In my spare time I still perform FPGA based research, as well as being involved in STEM UK as an ambassador and dedicating time to the REMAP project - supplying custom equipment to disabled people where no commercial solution exists. 

This site is intended to provide complete guides to using FPGA technology for dynamic reconfiguration. The information contained within is the knowledge that I have gathered during my studies and employment. There is no affiliation to any manufacturer.
